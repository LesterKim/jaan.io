debugging probabilistic programs:

- gradient checks with high-variance gradients
- start in 2D: visualize simple binary / real-valued synthetic data.
- calculate exact numbers.
- nose tests that are probabilistic
- use cpp if possible, forces you to get the dimensions correct
- least LOC in ipython to get simple result
Good practices for programming probabilistic inference

Look at stuff in idonethis. C.f. ali’s blog post, and neil lawrence’s blog post, and the faculty at google’s blog post: linting, etc.
